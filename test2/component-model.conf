The TCS provides telemetry streams to control several components of IRIS:

* **OIWFS probe arms**: The three arms are continuously positioned over guide stars.
* **5 ADCs**: Three OIWFS probe arms, the imager, and the IFU.
* **rotator**: IRIS is rotated to compensate sidereal rotation and changes in pupil rotation, thus maintaining a stable scientific image.
